# Algorithms in Java

## Description

This is a personal project where I set myself challenges to improve my programming logic, implement good coding practices, and develop algorithms that could be applied to real-world projects. Through these algorithms, I aim to continuously learn and enhance my programming skills.

## Project Structure

Each algorithm is organized into an individual folder. Inside each folder, youâ€™ll find detailed explanations of how the algorithm works and its purpose. These examples can serve as a reference to practice concepts and improve algorithm development, just as I am doing.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the appropriate tools to work in a Java development environment, such as:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
- A compatible code editor (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support)
- Basic command-line knowledge to compile and run Java programs

Explore the algorithms, learn, and enjoy coding!
